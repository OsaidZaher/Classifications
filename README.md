This Repository depicts some of the work I am doing in my machine learning journey; specifically classications models.

The first project is my own creation of a k nearest neighbour algorithm which is then used to on cleaned imbd data.
The k neighbour is predfined as 3 and when a new data point added we get a 100 percent validation accuracy when using the features and labeled trained on the model.

The second project is a way to identify the best k neighbour.Using cancer breast diagnosis dataset we see the ideal k value is 60 with an accuracy of over 96%

The last project is a decision tree classification model for a flags dataset.
